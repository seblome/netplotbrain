# # Node properties: size
#
# Netplotbrain allows for specifying different figure properties by only specifyign the column name.
#
# Below we demonstrate how node_size can change based on different columns in the nodes dataframe.
#
# The key lines of code here are when:
#
# `node_size='centrality_measure1'`
#
# and
#
# `node_size='centrality_measure2'`
#
# These columns could be called anything such as "module_degree_zscore" or "efficiency"
