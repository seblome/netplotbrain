# ## Plotting significant results from network based statistics
# Netplotbrain aims to try and integrate with other tools, minimizing the work needed.
# For this we are going to use bctpy's implementation of network based statistics.

### Generating the data

To run NBS statistics we need connectivity matrices for multiple subjects.
The data we will need is a N x N x S array for two separate groups, where N is the number of nodes and S is the number of subjects.

In this subsection we will create dummy data to simulate the point. Skip to the next subsection if you just want to see how netplotbrain integrates with NBS statistics.

We are going to create connectivity matrices with 100 nodes for 50 subjects.
The 100 nodes will be split into 6 communities of varying sizes.
Edge weights will be sampled from a normal distribution with the standard deviation set to 0.25.
The mean of the normal distribution for each edge varies.
For between-community edges the mean is set to 0. For within community edges each community is set to a different value. This value will differ between the two groups.
